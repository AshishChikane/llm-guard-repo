Here's a simple app, written in pure Python, to create a demo website for LLM Guard.
The app is based on the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) package.

A live version can be found here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/laiyer/llm-guard-demo

## Requirements

1. Clone the repo and move to the `examples/demo` folder

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the app:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Output

Output should be similar to this screenshot:
