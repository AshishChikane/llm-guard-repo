# Toxicity Scanner

It is designed to assess the toxicity level of the content generated by language models, acting as a safeguard against
potentially harmful or offensive output.

## Attack scenario

Language models, when interacting with users, can sometimes produce responses that may be deemed toxic or inappropriate.
This poses a risk, as such output can perpetuate harm or misinformation. By monitoring and classifying the model's
output, potential toxic content can be flagged and handled appropriately.

## How it works

The scanner employs the [unitary/unbiased-toxic-roberta](https://huggingface.co/unitary/unbiased-toxic-roberta) from
HuggingFace to evaluate the generated text's toxicity level.

## Usage

```python
from llm_guard.output_scanners import Toxicity

scanner = Toxicity(threshold=0.7)
sanitized_output, is_valid, risk_score = scanner.scan(prompt, model_output)
```

## Optimizations

### ONNX

The scanner can run on ONNX Runtime, which provides a significant performance boost on CPU instances. It uses a
converted model [laiyer/unbiased-toxic-roberta-onnx](https://huggingface.co/laiyer/unbiased-toxic-roberta-onnx) for
that.

To enable it, install the `onnxruntime` package:

```sh
pip install llm-guard[onnxruntime]
```

And set `use_onnx=True`.

## Benchmarks

Test setup:

- Platform: Amazon Linux 2
- Python Version: 3.11.6
- Input length: 217
- Test times: 5

Run the following script:

```sh
python benchmarks/run.py output Toxicity
```
